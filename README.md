# To do list web app 
You can create tasks and edit their name, description, status and date.
Really early version

### Available features:
- adding tasks
- editing tasks
- removing tasks
- saving tasks in localStorage
### Things I'm planning to add:
- dark mode
- responsiveness
- drag and drop
- adding task without a date or desc and showing error message when name is missing
